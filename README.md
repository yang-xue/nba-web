## Nba-web

Nba-web is a web app visualizing NBA player stats. It aims to present data fecthed from stats.nba.com for any player you would like to search. The display would include the player profile with general personal information, and shooting chart which helps you identify trends, strengths, weaknesses, and ultimately give you insights to improve your team's overall shooting percentage.

The app was once deployed on AWS Amplify Deployment and was able to access via a domain URL. But this is no longer supported. Please take a look at the photos and description below.
